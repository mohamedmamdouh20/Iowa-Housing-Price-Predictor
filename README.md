# Iowa Housing Price Predictor

This project utilizes various regression techniques to predict house prices based on the Iowa Housing dataset. It includes a Streamlit app for interactive predictions and model evaluation.

## Techniques Used

- **Multiple Linear Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Simple Linear Regression**

## Evaluation Metrics

- **R-squared Score**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

## Files

- `main.py`: Code for training and evaluating the regression models.
- `app.py`: Streamlit application for interactive predictions.
- `LOWA_dataset/`: Folder containing the Iowa Housing dataset.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies for running the code.

## Getting Started
